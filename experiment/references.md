  - It talks about the process and its memory,it has a brief description on what the 4 sections of the process memory are
  - It describes the 5 state process cycle and describes each state briefly
  - The website also describes the PCB and its components
  - It also compares processes and programs
  - It also describes what a “good” scheduling algorithm has. -->
