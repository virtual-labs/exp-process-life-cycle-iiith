  This webpage provides concise descriptions of each state in the seven-step process cycle. It first gives an explanation of the  five states of the cycle which are the new, ready, running, waiting and completed states. then the site  explains how the final two states Suspend Ready and Suspend Blocked state connect to it .

This video has a detailed description on the 5 state process cycle.

The 7 state cycle is fully explained on this page. Here you will find a brief explanation of the reasons for each state's transition from one to the other. It talks about the state of the process and how it matches to where the process is in the memory.

  - It talks about the process and its memory,it has a brief description on what the 4 sections of the process memory are
  - It describes the 5 state process cycle and describes each state briefly
  - The website also describes the PCB and its components
  - It also compares processes and programs
  - It also describes what a “good” scheduling algorithm has. -->
