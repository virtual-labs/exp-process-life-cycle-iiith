        "a": "Is not a correct definition of an interrupt because it describes a blocked process that is waiting for a resource to become available, rather than an interrupt.",
        "b": "an interrupt is essentially a signal that requests the operating system to perform a specific task on behalf of a process. When a process needs to access a resource or perform an operation that requires the operating system's intervention, it issues an interrupt. ",

        "c": "When a process runs for a long time without being interrupted, it can prevent other processes from running and degrade the overall system performance. The timer interrupt ensures that the CPU is periodically taken away from the running process and is made available to other processes waiting to run.",
