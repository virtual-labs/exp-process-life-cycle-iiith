### Theory

#### What is a process?

In computing, a process is an instance of a computer program that is being executed by a computer's operating system (OS). A process consists of the program's code and its current activity, such as the values of its variables, the state of its I/O channels, and its position in memory.
Processes are managed by the operating system, which allocates resources such as CPU time, memory, and I/O devices to each process as needed. The OS also provides mechanisms for inter-process communication, synchronization, and coordination.
Each process is assigned a unique identifier, known as a process ID (PID), which can be used to identify and manage the process. The operating system maintains a process table that stores information about each running process, such as its PID, its priority, and its resource usage.
In a multitasking operating system, multiple processes may be running simultaneously, sharing the system resources. The OS schedules the execution of these processes, switching between them rapidly to give the illusion of parallel execution. This allows multiple programs to be run concurrently, which can improve the overall performance of the system.

#### What is a PCB?

In operating systems, PCB stands for "Process Control Block". A Process Control Block is a data structure that the operating system uses to manage information about each process that is currently running on the system.
The PCB contains important information about a process, such as its current state, its program counter (the address of the next instruction to be executed), the values of its CPU registers, the memory space allocated to the process, the I/O devices that the process is using, and other relevant information.
The operating system uses the information in the PCB to manage the scheduling of processes, to allocate system resources such as CPU time and memory to each process, and to provide services such as inter-process communication and synchronization.
The PCB is typically stored in the operating system's memory and is updated by the operating system as a process runs. When a process is suspended or terminated, its PCB is usually removed from the system's memory to free up resources.
Overall, the PCB is a critical data structure that allows the operating system to manage and control the execution of multiple processes on a computer system.

PCBS have 3 types of information in it:

* Identification information: 
 - Process ID: Unique id that is assigned to a process at the time of creation.
* Process state information:
 - Process State:  will contain the current state of the process.
 - the contents of the PSW(Program Status Word): is used to store the current status of the processor or CPU.
 - the general-purpose registers (GPRs): content of the registers when the process last got blocked or preempted
* Information to control operation: 
 - priority: numerical value assigned to process at creation(changeable value)
and its interaction with other processes: 
 - PCB pointer : The PCB pointer is used by the operating system to quickly access and modify the information stored in the PCB for a given process
 - IPC messages : Interprocess communication messages are a way for processes in an operating system to exchange data and information with each other,and typically involve sending and receiving data between two or more processes. 



#### What are process states?

As a process is executed, it undergoes a series of state changes that reflect the activity being performed by the user and the resources needed by the process. The specific states and their corresponding names can vary between different operating systems and literature sources, as they are not standardized. Nonetheless, the process state provides crucial information about the current status of a process and is used by the operating system to manage resources and scheduling.

The 4 main and most common states the process can exist as are:
* Ready: A process in the ready state is one that is waiting to be executed by the CPU, but is currently not running. The process is waiting for the CPU to allocate resources to it, and is typically waiting in a queue for its turn to run.
* Running: When a process is executing instructions on the CPU, it is in the running state.At any given time, there may be only one process in the running state on a single CPU.
* Waiting :if the process is in this state then it is waiting for either resources that it has requested for or waiting for a specific event  to occur so that it can go back to ready state and wait for dispatching The process is not using the CPU during this time and may be waiting for an indefinite period.
* Terminated: When a process has completed its execution or has been terminated by the operating system or by the user, it is in the terminated state. The process may still have some resources allocated to it, but it is no longer running.

####  What are the possible process state transitions?

* Ready → Running(dispatch):
 - The process has been dispatched to the CPU
 - The CPU will then either begin or resume execution of the process instructions

* Running → Ready(Preempt):
 - The process has been preempted
 - Meaning that the kernel has decided to schedule some other process for execution
 - This could be based on various criteria:
 - There is a process with higher priority that has become ready
 - The time slice or quantum of the process has passed.
 
* Running → Waiting(resource or Wait request):

 - The process in execution has decided to wait until the resources that it has requested for have been granted or it has decided to wait until a certain event the process is waiting for has been completed
 - There are 5 main reasons a process enters the wait state are:
  - Process requests for a resource
  - Process requests for I/O
  - Process wishes to wait for specific time interval
  - Waiting for message from another process
  - Waiting for action done by another process

* Waiting → Ready(Wait completed or resource request granted):
 - The resource request of the process has been granted
 - The event the process was waiting for has been completed

* Running → Terminated(terminate):
 - The process is terminated,this could be due to several reasons: 
 - Execution of program is completed
 - Self termination: 
  - the process has completed its execution completely
  - Process can no longer execute meaningfully
 In these cases the process makes a system call”terminate me”
- Exceeding resource utilization: 
 - OS can limit the resources that a process may consume
 - If the process exceeds resource limit it will get aborted by the kernel
- Abnormal conditions during execution:
 - If there are any abnormal conditions coming up during execution of instructions 
 - Execution of invalid instructions
 - Exec of privileged instructions
 - Memory protection violation
- Incorrect interaction with other processes:
 - The kernel may abort a process if it gets involved in a deadlock.
